Another Watch Winder.

I did not want to buy one. So, I made it. Note, I am not a Python programmer. In fact, I hate Python. But this was the fastest way to start winding my watch.

This project uses ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather controller from Adafruit. It has a tiny screen and 4 buttons, which I am using. The software is very simple. It can spin watch right, left or 5 turns in each direction. I am sure it can be improved and optimized.

Plastic parts were printed in PLA first. But then the motor got hot and destroyed the winder. So, the latest winder was printed in carbon-filled PETG. Works fine so far. Also, the motor current has to be adjusted to the minimum at which motor will still spin. There is no need in high torque and motor stays cool.

Cross-board was prototyped at home. Version 1.2 was sent for manufacturing.
